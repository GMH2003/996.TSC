### Declaration

 - 996.TSC cultural products are submitted by GitHub open source community developers, available for use, reprint, etc., but are not commercially available. If not, do not submit.

 - 996.ICU is an initiative initiated by developers. We welcome people from other fields and other countries to join the discussion.

 - This is not a political movement. We firmly uphold the labor law. We require employers to respect the legitimate rights and interests of employees.

 - From closed source to open source is a great progress. From open source to emphasizing the protection of labor rights will also be a great progress. We want to create an open source software license that advocates protecting the rights of workers.

 - We welcome all positive and constructive suggestions and advocate for mature and responsible statements.

 - Currently, the Anti 996 License is in the drafting stage and I hope that professionals with relevant experience can help.
